# microTonic
* It's just tonic all ripped up and torn to pieces

# Synth
* This is more or less the main function to build synthesizers
* It's a pretty cool little kit but needs more modules
* Why I took it apart so we can add more stuff to it
* It is a good foundation for the beginning of a synthesizer

# Modular
* The goal is to extend it to support making tiny modular systems
